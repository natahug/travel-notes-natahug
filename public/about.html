        Nice to meet you too.

Iâ€™m Natalie Huggins, a current student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Journalism. I am hoping to implement my tech skills in a creative environment within the UX/UI space. Besides programming and designing I enjoy wasting many hours making Spotify playlists, drinking bubble tea, trying to rhyme the thoughts in my head into poems, and dancing to the beat of my own drum.
