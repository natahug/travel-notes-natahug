                    <br>
                    <p class ="post-text">Let's just state for the record--I don't bike for function, or for sport that matter, or really even for fun as of the last couple years. Good to get that off my chest. 
                        <br><br>
                        Today the class meets across from colorful Nyhavn, at Copenhagen Bikes, to do something terrifying and joing the fleet of thousands of Copenhagen bikers. I know how to ride a bike, I learned when I was ten. I did not learn this kind of biking. Imagine every street with a bike lane and little bike stoplights at each intersection--except take out some of the bike lanes on certain roads, add in hand-turning signals I keep forgetting, and take out left-hand turns completely, and you still won't get it--because I certainly didn't. Traveling in a clumsy thort of 20 amatuer cyclists, our fearless leader Kris led us to the meeting spot with the tour guide across town. And the tour began. A single file- line of 20 foreign bikers that are unaware of the rules of biking in Copenhagen, and then taught the rules, and very privy to immediately forget/confuse said rules--pisses Danes off on their morning commute to work. I can't say I blame them. Traveling from Nyhavn through Fredricksberg and the next part of town (I can't remember) we learn about how the city of Copenhagen was planned around "green spaces," how circular benches open people up to conversating more freely with strangers, and how much money is saved by the amount of citizens of the city that commute by bike. Our tour guide weaves in her political views as well, as there's an election happening as we're here (I think, I've forgot to mention this). There's hundreds of posters that fill every space of the city, with candidates faces, and their affliated political party (there are 10 here I learn). She says the Danish are very "un-politically correct" people, and speaks of Sweeden's opposite views (She's Sweedish), I enjoy the sassy lines she has to say about the political environment, and the passion of her delivery. 
                        <br><br>
                        We make it through the tour alive, ending in another section of the city I forget the name of, which is terrible for documentation I realize. The tour guide brings us to a community center that fills the space of an old church, said to have cheap coffee and games. We enter to find a colorfully painted space, serve a few pings and pongs, snap some subtle pictures, and then break off in groups to find lunch. My group comes across a pizza place and orders individual pizzas to eat outside the cutest cafe area I think I've seen yet. If I figure out if I want to put pictures in these posts, remind me to include it here:
                        <br><br>
                        Anyway, after the pizza is eaten, and we manage to make it back to the bike rental place. Even though I've hated pissing Danes off all morning, doing the wrong things at intersections, accidentally cutting people off, and tripping to start at every green stoplight, something in me urges to rent a bike for the month when the man asks us. Some others are interested too, and still terrified of biking, I spend the $23 to force myself out of my comfort zone (something about being comfortable being uncomfortable I think they said). We have class once we're all back. I hit a wall once we're all back. A day of simply doing the wrong things, and the Danish people letting me know it caught up to me. I felt a little disheartened and discouraged by the day, feeling like a comeplete stand out tourist, which I hate. A bubble waffle with Nutella and a chat with Sabrina makes me feel better. I haven't seen her since our flight landed, as she lives a metro ride and hop/skip away. I meet her flatmates, and catch up, show her my apartment, which I find out is significantly cooler than hers, and see her off to the metro again. A friend this far from home is a blessing, and even though I find myself becoming quickly close with those on in my program, its really great to see her.

                    <p class ="post-text">Today I'm woken up by the weridest rumbling noises outside the window, and immediately excited for the day. We all get dresses for the DIS opening ceremony at 8:30 am. Its held in an old circus building we're told --and we weren't prepared for what that meant. We walk through an entry way into an enormous oom with a domed ceiling. There's a large stage and stadium seating arranged in candle-lit tables of 4. The room mainly dark and lit with purple lights. We hear from the director of DIS and a cool music group called Drew. We're dismissed to class. 
                        <br><br>
                        Lydia, Maggie and I manage to get overpriced coffee at a small coffee shop out of the way of the main street we come from after the opening ceremony. I get an espesso shot in the attempt to save some money, and down my decision like a shot (of coffee). We get lost trying to find the right building for our class, and see the city a little in the process. We make it to class, Kris Jordan assures us we should be embarrassed of our websites at this point, I'm relieved. And excited to learn. 
                        <br><br>
                        Burgers for lunch. Nice waiter, who teaches me how to say "Thanks" in Danish, it's "Tak" for those at home. More class, learning a lot already. More class. Family dinner at RizRaz which is now home to my favorite falafal--scoot over MedDeli, and thoughts of the Ice Bar. Bail on Ice Bar, try to rally the troops for somesort of celebrate for Emily's 21st birthday, which we must honor by consequence simply in principle! After gathering those willing to venture out to bars on a Tuesday night, we do just that, and honestly I'm hoping I don't have to document what happened next because truly it was dissappointly lame, and I'm banking on better nights out. Please God let me be right about this, Tuesday is not Copenhagen's night.

                    <p class ="post-text">Hello and yes Copenhagen is confirmed a beautiful city. Upon the arrival and navigation to the DIS dorms I've noticed a lot of stylish people, on bikes wearing weird black neck pillows (??) and smelled a lot of smoke of all kinds (!!). I'm settled in Store Kannikestæde (and yes have no idea how to pronounce that word, c'mon) with Selina, Taylor and Anna--all of whom I met only once prior (the once prior being the predeparture meeting (well the one I attended)). We're set up in a beautiful building, on the ground floor, in a spaceous room with four twin beds, three large windows that let in all the sounds of the street, and all Ikea furniture (as one expects and appreciates).
                        <br><br>
                        We venture to a grocery store around the corner. And I find it hard to do Kroner-Dollar conversions in my head, but make it to the checkout with a loaf of fluffy seed bread, peanut butter (which looks suspiciously pale), 3 bananas, a case of water bottles, dried papaya and some sort of waffle candy wafer.  I'm elated when my credit card doesn't get declined at the register, and consider the trip a success. 
                        <br><br>
                        Pizza for dinner later and a Game of Thrones marathon. A very weird shower. And a very good sleep.
