                    <p class ="post-text">Today I'm woken up by the weridest rumbling noises outside the window, and immediately excited for the day. We all get dresses for the DIS opening ceremony at 8:30 am. Its held in an old circus building we're told --and we weren't prepared for what that meant. We walk through an entry way into an enormous oom with a domed ceiling. There's a large stage and stadium seating arranged in candle-lit tables of 4. The room mainly dark and lit with purple lights. We hear from the director of DIS and a cool music group called Drew. We're dismissed to class. 
                        <br><br>
                        Lydia, Maggie and I manage to get overpriced coffee at a small coffee shop out of the way of the main street we come from after the opening ceremony. I get an espesso shot in the attempt to save some money, and down my decision like a shot (of coffee). We get lost trying to find the right building for our class, and see the city a little in the process. We make it to class, Kris Jordan assures us we should be embarrassed of our websites at this point, I'm relieved. And excited to learn.

                        Burgers for lunch. Nice waiter, who teaches me how to say "Thanks" in Danish, it's "Tak" for those at home. More class, learning a lot already.

                    <p class ="post-text">Hello and yes Copenhagen is confirmed a beautiful city. Upon the arrival and navigation to the DIS dorms I've noticed a lot of stylish people, on bikes wearing weird black neck pillows (??) and smelled a lot of smoke of all kinds (!!). I'm settled in Store Kannikest√¶de (and yes have no idea how to pronounce that word, c'mon) with Selina, Taylor and Anna--all of whom I met only once prior (the once prior being the predeparture meeting (well the one I attended)). We're set up in a beautiful building, on the ground floor, in a spaceous room with four twin beds, three large windows that let in all the sounds of the street, and all Ikea furniture (as one expects and appreciates).
                        <br><br>
                        We venture to a grocery store around the corner. And I find it hard to do Kroner-Dollar conversions in my head, but make it to the checkout with a loaf of fluffy seed bread, peanut butter (which looks suspiciously pale), 3 bananas, a case of water bottles, dried papaya and some sort of waffle candy wafer.  I'm elated when my credit card doesn't get declined at the register, and consider the trip a success. 
                        <br><br>
                        Pizza for dinner later and a Game of Thrones marathon. A very weird shower. And a very good sleep.

          <p class ="post-text">Tomorrow I board a plane with my best friend to Copenhagen. Tomorrow I get to contemplate buying a riduculously overpriced neck pillow in the airport when I get there way too many hours before my plane boards. Tomorrow I get to sit next to a stranger, and decide if I should keep to myself or exchange life-stories. Tomorrow I get to land in Copenhagen, Denmark, a city and a country completely unknown to me.

              Until tomorrow then.
