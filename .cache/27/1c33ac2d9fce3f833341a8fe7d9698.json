We all get dresses for the DIS opening ceremony at 8:30 am. Its held in an old circus building we're told --and we weren't prepared for what that meant. We walk through an entry way into an enormous oom with a domed ceiling. There's a large stage and stadium seating arranged in candle-lit tables of 4. The room mainly dark and lit with purple lights. We hear from the director of DIS and a cool music group called Drew. We're dismissed to class. \n                        <br><br>\n                        Lydia, Maggie and I manage to get overpriced coffee at a small coffee shop out of the way of the main street we come from after the opening ceremony. I get an espesso shot in the attempt to save some money, and down my decision like a shot (of coffee). We get lost trying to find the right building for our class, and see the city a little in the process. We make it to class, Kris Jordan assures us we should be embarrassed of our websites at this point, I'm relieved. And excited to learn. \n                        <br><br>\n                        Burgers for lunch. Nice waiter, who teaches me how to say \"Thanks\" in Danish, it's \"Tak\" for those at home. More class, learning a lot already.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"blank\"></div>\n            <div class=\"post-box\">\n                    <p class=\"date\"><strong><em>May 20th, 2019: So this is Copenhagen</em></strong></p>\n                    <br>\n                    <p class=\"post-text\">Hello and yes Copenhagen is confirmed a beautiful city. Upon the arrival and navigation to the DIS dorms I've noticed a lot of stylish people, on bikes wearing weird black neck pillows (??) and smelled a lot of smoke of all kinds (!!). I'm settled in Store Kannikest√¶de (and yes have no idea how to pronounce that word, c'mon) with Selina, Taylor and Anna--all of whom I met only once prior (the once prior being the predeparture meeting (well the one I attended)). We're set up in a beautiful building, on the ground floor, in a spaceous room with four twin beds, three large windows that let in all the sounds of the street, and all Ikea furniture (as one expects and appreciates).\n                        <br><br>\n                        We venture to a grocery store around the corner. And I find it hard to do Kroner-Dollar conversions in my head, but make it to the checkout with a loaf of fluffy seed bread, peanut butter (which looks suspiciously pale), 3 bananas, a case of water bottles, dried papaya and some sort of waffle candy wafer.  I'm elated when my credit card doesn't get declined at the register, and consider the trip a success. \n                        <br><br>\n                        Pizza for dinner later and a Game of Thrones marathon. A very weird shower. And a very good sleep.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"blank\"></div>\n            <div class=\"post-box\">\n                    <p class=\"date\"><strong><em>May 20th, 2019: Somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean</em></strong></p>\n                    <br>\n                    <p class=\"post-text\">Flying into London (my first destination en route to Copenhagen) this morning listening to Here Comes the Sun by the Beatles and I don't even care it's just for a 3 hour layover. \n                        <br><br>\n                        Or if it's incredibly corny.\n                        <br><br>\n                        Update: Landed (yes literally the pilot needed me to take over) the 7 hour flight and navigating Heathrow airport (by way of 2 very unorganized shuttle rides), Sabrina and I boarded our flight to our final destination. \n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"blank\"></div>\n          <div class=\"post-box\">\n          <p class=\"date\"><strong><em>May 19th, 2019: Departing Tomorrow</em></strong></p>\n          <br>\n          <p class=\"post-text\">Tomorrow I board a plane with my best friend to Copenhagen.
