                    <p class ="post-text">Up at 5:30am, packed for the weekend and on the fuchsia bus by 6:45, we make our way to Aarhus-- the second largest city in Denmark I'm told. On the bus I try to catch some z's as we travel to our first stop, the Jelling Stones (pronounce "Yelling"), which are the oldest written records in Denmark, dating back to Nordic Times. 
                        <br><br>
                        As we arrive to see the Jelling Stones we are greeted by a nice older tour guide in a long purple coat. I forget my rain coat in the bus. I forget my rain coat in the bus and its freezing cold and drizzling outside. I forget my rain coat in the bus and the wind picks up. I forget my rain coat in the bus, but try to push through and focus on the history of Denmark, King Gorm and so on, and really it is quite cool. There’re two mounds on either side of a church, and the Jelling Stones, there’s two, are displayed between one mound and the side of the church. They are protected by glass that I'm told is temperature controlled. The tour guide speaks of how the language written on the stones is Runes, a Viking language carved in stones with horizontal lines. The short story is the older stone was carved by King Gorm for his wife Thyra. On the stone, he honors his wife and declares himself King of Denmark. Here is the first mention of the name of the country and the declaration of one of the oldest monarchies. The second stone is done by Gorm’s son Harald, who is responsible for making Denmark a Christian nation. In my head, I recognize that this spot is significant to Danish history, and try to appreciate it, while seemingly being utterly distracted by the wind and rain that causes my mind to wander toward homeostasis. We leave the Jelling stones, and eat lunch at an indoor food-truck- street-ma-bob-er place I've coined it. The fish and chips are good, and also are  $15 or 100 DKK and the tartar sauce is weirdly reminiscent of ranch. 
                        <br><br>
                       Here's what you've all been waiting for, or at least what I've been waiting for: Aarhus Google! We bus to the small branch located next to the university in Aarhus. The exterior isn't quite impressive, just more of the same Danish minimalism I'm truly a fan of, but as soon as we walk in you get that Googl-ey "damn this is nice, and look at all the cool modern furniture" vibe. I'm ecstatic, despite the deep-set fatigue I fight back underneath a waning dose of caffeine. And then we meet Mads-- Mads Ager, one of the original engineers of the V8 JavaScript engine. Which is a big deal in the world of the internet. And he was something else. The man is obviously well-versed in his field of work, having accomplished significant success in his career since V8, but more than that, he is incredibly likable. I'll admit, I was expecting a quiet, impressive- yet reclusive Mads of a minimalist-keep-to-yourself- Danish fashion, but the Mads I met was a human full of energy, excitement and passion for his work, that spoke in a way that didn't make you feel confused in a bad or overwhelming way, but in a way the inspired. He was funny, expressive, and real. He was full of earnest, genuine passion for his job, and his ability to impact the web. He wasn't boastful of his enormous success, he humbly presented himself and his past projects, but emphasized his current work. The takeaways were extensive-- I was annoyed to realize the value in COMP 411, and theoretical time complexities of COMP 410, both of which I found boring last semester, but mainly just inspired to find something in computer science that made me as excited to come to work as Mads. His enthusiasm was infectious. And even if it's not about programming languages and their optimization, I want to find that. I want to find that enthusiasm.
                        <br><br>
                       And so, we all left Google with goofy smiles, and Google mugs, settled into the cutest hotel in the middle of Aarhus, and headed to another group dinner. This one might be my favorite so far, some sort of chicken burger with fries and ice cream for dessert (apple, cinnamon, and lemon flavored). The sad part of this day is that I crashed after dinner and slept through a roof-top bar outing, and cute little swing. I've decided to not be bothered by the loss and live in the moment not the past.

                    <br>
                    <p class ="post-text">Let's just state for the record--I don't bike for function, or for sport that matter, or really even for fun as of the last couple years. Good to get that off my chest. 
                        <br><br>
                        Today the class meets across from colorful Nyhavn, at Copenhagen Bikes, to do something terrifying and join the fleet of probably ba-gillions (this is accurate) of Copenhagen commuter-bikers. I know how to ride a bike, I learned when I was ten. I did not learn this kind of biking. Imagine every street with a bike lane and little bike stoplights at each intersection--except take out some of the bike lanes on certain roads, add in hand-turning signals I keep forgetting, and take out left-hand turns completely, and you still won't get it--because I certainly didn't. Traveling in a clumsy band of 20 amateur cyclists, our fearless leader Kris led us to the meeting spot with the tour guide across town. And the tour began. 
                        <br><br>
                         A single file- line of 20 foreign bikers that are unaware of the rules of biking in Copenhagen, then taught the rules, and inevitably prone to immediately forget/confuse said rules--pisses Danes off on their morning commute to work. I can't say I blame them. Traveling from Nyhavn through Frederiksberg and the next part of town (I can't remember) we learn about how the city of Copenhagen was planned around "green spaces," how circular benches open people up to conversating more freely with strangers, and how much money is saved by the number of citizens of the city that commute by bike. Our tour guide weaves in her political views as well, as there's an election happening as we're here (I think, I've forgotten to mention this). There’re hundreds of posters that fill every space of the city, with candidates faces, and their affiliated political party (there are 10 here I learn). She says the Danish are not very “politically correct" and speaks of Sweden’s opposite views (She's Swedish), I enjoy the sassy lines she has to say about the political environment, and the passion of her delivery.  
                        <br><br>
                        We make it through the tour alive, ending in another section of the city I forget the name of, which is terrible for documentation purposes I realize. The tour guide brings us to a community center that fills the space of an old church, said to have cheap coffee and games. We enter to find a colorfully painted space, serve a few pings and return a view pongs, snap some subtle pictures, and then break off into groups to find lunch. My group comes across a pizza place and orders individual pizzas to eat outside the cutest cafe area I think I've seen yet. If I figure out if I want to put pictures in these posts, remind me to include it here:
                        <br><br>
                        After the pizza is eaten, we manage to make it back to the bike rental place. Even though I've hated pissing Danes off all morning, doing the wrong things at intersections, accidentally cutting people off, and tripping to start at every green stoplight, something in me compels me to rent a bike for the month when the man asks us. Some others are interested too, and still terrified of biking, I spend the $23 to force myself out of my comfort zone (something about being comfortable being uncomfortable I think they said). We have class once we're all back. I hit a wall once we're all back. A day of simply doing the wrong things, and the Danish people letting me know it—caught up to me. I felt a little disheartened and discouraged by the day, feeling like a complete stand-out tourist, which I hate. A bubble waffle with Nutella and a chat with Sabrina makes me feel better. I haven't seen her since our flight landed, as she lives a metro ride and hop/skip away. I meet her flat mates, and catch up, show her my apartment, which I find out is significantly cooler than hers, and see her off to the metro again. A friend this far from home is a blessing, and even though I find myself becoming quickly close with those on in my program, it’s really great to see her.

                    <br>
                    <p class ="post-text">Today I'm woken up by the weirdest rumbling noises outside the window, and immediately excited for the day, this time I think genuinely. We all get dressed for the DIS opening ceremony at 8:30 am. It’s held in an old circus building we're told --and we weren't prepared for what that meant. We walk through an entry way into an enormous room with a domed ceiling. There's a large stage and stadium seating arranged in candle-lit tables of 4. The room is mainly dark and glows with a dim purple light. We hear from the director of DIS and a cool music group called Drew. We're dismissed to class. 
                        <br><br>
                        On the way to our classroom, Lydia, Maggie and I manage to get overpriced coffee at a small coffee shop out of the way of the main street. I get a single espresso shot in the attempt to save some money, and down my decision regretfully. We get lost trying to find the right building for our class, and see the city a little in the process. We make it to class, Kris Jordan assures us we should be embarrassed of our websites at this point, I'm relieved. And excited to learn. 
                        <br><br>
                        Burgers for lunch—oh how we love immersing ourselves in Danish culture, I know. But, there’s a nice waiter who teaches me how to say "Thanks" in Danish, it's "Tak" for those at home. And then there’s more class, and more learning. Family dinner at RizRaz, which is now home to my favorite falafel—scoot over MedDeli, and thoughts of the Ice Bar.<br><br> Bail on Ice Bar, try to rally the troops for some sort of celebration for Emily's 21st birthday, which we must honor with copious amounts of drinking simply in principle! After gathering those willing to venture out to bars on a Tuesday night, we do just that, and honestly, I'm hoping I don't have to document what happened next, because truly it was disappointingly lame, and I'm banking on better nights out. Please God let me be right about this, Tuesday is not Copenhagen's night. But we persist in the pursuit of gosh dern fun times to come.

                    <p class ="post-text">Copenhagen is confirmed: a beautiful city, as far as I’ve seen, so far, this far, from home :-) Upon the arrival and navigation to the DIS dorms I've noticed a lot of fashionable locals on bikes wearing weird black neck pillows (??), and smelling of smoke of all kinds (!!). I'm settled in Store Kannikestæde (and yes have no idea how to pronounce that word, c'mon) with Selina, Taylor and Anna--all of whom I have only met once before. We're set up in a beautiful building, on the ground floor, in a spacious room with four twin beds, three large windows that let in all the sounds of the street, and all Ikea furniture, as one expects and appreciates. And as I settle in, I’m unsettled, nervous. And as I gush generic sentiments about how excited I am about the program, I’m not excited, I’m scared. Ignore that last part though this is supposed to be a chance of a lifetime.
                        <br><br>
                        We venture to a grocery store around the corner. And I find it hard to do Kroner-Dollar conversions in my head, but make it to the checkout with a loaf of fluffy seed bread, peanut butter (which looks suspiciously pale), 3 bananas, a case of water bottles, dried papaya and some sort of waffle candy wafer.  I'm elated when my credit card doesn't get declined at the register, and consider the trip a success. 
                        <br><br>
                        Pizza for dinner later and a Game of Thrones marathon. A very weird shower. And a very good sleep.
