        <p>Iâ€™m Natalie Huggins, a current student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Journalism. I am hoping to implement my tech skills in a creative environment within the UX/UI space. </p>

        <p>Besides programming and designing I enjoy wasting many hours making Spotify playlists, drinking bubble tea, trying to rhyme the thoughts in my head into poems.

        <p>I am super excited to be going to Copenhagen for COMP 426. It's probably the most exciting thing to happen to me...ever.</p>
